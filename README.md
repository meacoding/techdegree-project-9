## Technologies and skills used 

+ HTML
+ CSS
+ JavaScript
+ jQuery
+ Animate.css


## Reason for creation
To build a real portfolio with actual projects I've made using any and all technologies learned in the Techdegree FEWD program. Final project.

## What I did

The Treehouse course data was imported with `$.getJSON()`. In "View Projects", the projects are revealed and animated with jQuery and CSS. In "Building Blocks", the white top hat blocks are animated with Animate.css. 

The scroll down "arrow" blocks I used to have in `id="section-landing"` was animated with jQuery which still exists in styles.css under the comment heading `The Droppy LEGOs`, in app.js under the comment heading `Header LEGO falling arrow` and at the bottom of the index.html where it was moved and commented out.
 
## Backstory

This is the final project. I started in a comfortable place with a one page website. As evidenced by the unfinished styling and large amounts of commented-out code, I scrapped this project.

No matter what I did to improve it, I just didn't like it. I had no design or master plan. I figured I'd discover what I'd want along the way. Funny enough that is exactly what happened when I stopped wasting my time on this and started a new one, which you can find here. That one ultimately became my portfolio and the one I submitted for review.

Why did I scrap it? I didn't know what to do with the mini-profile for myself, which is at the very top of the page. The "Building Blocks" listing my known technologies is okay although the animation is feels unnecessary. I wasn't sure how to display my projects. I knew I wanted a contact form at the bottom. I really like the Google form but it isn't modifiable and it's bulky. I originally wanted a video introduction of myself but currently it's out of date and it just seems weird and out of place.
